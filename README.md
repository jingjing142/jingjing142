### Hi, I'm Jing 👋

A career changer with a background in international affairs 🌏 I'm from Germany, but studied in the UK, and spent the past few years working in government relations, policy and political risk in London and Beijing 🌆 Most of what I know about code, I learned through self-studies, with the help of amazing resources such as The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp. 👩🏻‍💻
